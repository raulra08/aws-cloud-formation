    <p>Dear All,</p>

<p>I spent the weekend on a Group Executive Off-Site in the Alps and wrote the March ’17 edition of my newsletter on my journey back to London. I hope you’ll enjoy it.</p>

<p>1. HR</p>

<p>Quite a few colleagues have successfully completed their probationary period since the last staff meeting. Congratulations to Paul Cadman (promoted to Software Engineer), Phil Hudson (promoted to Lead Consultant), Catia, Anna, Manoj, Andre Müller, Paul Simmons, Teona, Paula, Lukasz and Alison (promoted to Lead Consultant).</p>

<p>Jan has tendered his resignation in order to emigrate to China in order to be with his wife, who has accepted a placement in Shanghai. Surprisingly for me, after his first month with Zuhlke, Nasan has decided that a career in a professional services firm is not for him and he has left us at the end of last week.</p>

<p>Arturo Pina has accepted our job offer as a Senior Project Manager. Arturo joins us from Equal Experts and comes with a wealth of experience in managing Agile projects. Arturo is from Spain and he began his career at Ioko building video on demand solutions. Ioko were acquired by Piksel and coincidentally, Arturo wrote a fair bit of the code that Jaksa, Immo and I investigated when we were working on a legal case between FilmFlex and Piksel.</p>

<p>Emese Kolarovzki has accepted our offer for a Project Support Accountant position and she will take over all Vertec related and accounts payable work. Moreover, we have decided that we are now large enough to in-source the accounting work that has so far been done by our Swiss colleagues and also the payroll processing from Swiss &amp; Williamson. We are pleased that Hashim Salim has accepted our offer to fill this role. Both Emese and Hashim will start on April 10th.</p>

<p>I have met with Daphne last week. Her MSc in Machine Learning is going well and she confirmed that she will be back in time for Camp.</p>

<p>We will have a staff meeting next Thursday, where we’ll discuss amongst the usual topics, the results of the Employee engagement survey and life as a consultant.</p>

<p>We have paid a deposit to be able to hold our Christmas party in the Bikeshed (just around the corner) on Friday December 1st. Ina will send you an outlook invitation shortly.</p>

<p>2. Projects</p>

<p>The HSBC Mobile X UK team is pushing ahead building new mobile app features for the first public release for UK customers at the end of May. In addition to the features, a fair bit of time is spent on ensuring that the platform, hosting, operations and support centre staff are ready for this release.</p>

<p>A second team was spawned off the Mobile X team that is building a platform for the global app that will see a roll-out in a number of different markets. Unlike the Mobile X UK app the global app will be natively built for iOS and Android.</p>

<p>In a meeting with the leadership team of HSBC Digital Solutions, the progress of the team building out the Security Platform was praised and the leaders were very happy with our performance.</p>

<p>The HSBC platform team is currently building an authorisation framework and also making inroads into improving the build and deployment pipeline.</p>

<p>The Drum Cussac GRM/TP system was demonstrated at trade show, which generated a lot of interest. We had expected the work to finish, but last Friday the client has told us that they would like to extend the team to build more valuable features. Because we had previously expected the work to come to an end next week, Huw has agreed to join the Mobile X team. He’ll be replaced by Andre Mueller on the Drum Cussac Team.</p>

<p>We have agreed a Statement of Work with LV= last year to extend our engagement until the end of March 2018. The work is now done mostly in Hitchin but the team are in the office on Fridays.</p>

<p>The Linde system that we built has so far been used successfully in a number of US hospital chains. A team consisting of Susan, Raiyan and Nasan built a set of further features for Linde’s Gas Cylinder tracking system, that are aimed at the European Market. The assignment was completed last week and we are currently negotiating a maintenance contract.</p>

<p>Raiyan will move on to build some more features for LiDCO in an engagement that started this week.</p>

<p>3. Sales</p>

<p>We are negotiating the Master Agreement with Ellipse (a subsidiary of Munich Re) currently. Ellipse, who insure group risk (Life, Private Medical, Critical Illness and Incapacity) want us to start work on a new quotation front-end in May. We can choose the technology stack for this project and it will be run from our office.</p>

<p>Mike has secured a verbal order for 20k worth of work on the Energenie Mihome app.</p>

<p>We are negotiating a statement of work to review a staff tablet application for HSBC in HongKong that Jaksa will undertake.</p>

<p>We are also negotiating an engagement with LGT Vestra Wealth for a system that will automate the creation of Factsheets of financial products, which are currently built manually. This will be a .NET system that we are hoping the Manchester team will take on shortly.</p>

<p>We are also working on a substantial bid for Third Bridge, who provide market intelligence and access to experts. The aim of that project will be to manage the wealth of knowledge that Third Bridge Analysts create in a systematic manner that is supported by an IT system. We have had several meetings with the client so far and will have another meeting shortly to discuss requirements so that we can estimate the budget required for this work.</p>

<p>Mike is pursuing interesting leads at Centrica for an oil monitoring component in combined heat/power engines and to IoT enable home boilers for Hive.</p>

<p>We are pursuing a number of further leads that will bring work for the Manchester team. This includes an augmented reality application for utilities that overlays cable and pipe routing on images taken by a phone/tablet camera and a discovery for innovations that improve the efficiency in the logistics chain of AO.com, the leading on-line white goods manufacturers.</p>

<p>4. Finance</p>

<p>Zuhlke UK has had a good start into the new year. We have outperformed our rolling forecast on revenue by £200k and our EBITB is on target. We have also succeeded in obtaining a substantial tax refund for the R&amp;D we carried out ourselves and on behalf of our clients in 2015.</p>

<p>5. Giving something back</p>

<p>I have agreed with Ileana that we will change the fruit provider to one who sources them from sustainable and organic growers and they promise that they will plant a tree for each basket we buy.</p>

<p>John is putting together a batch of laptops that we now longer use because they are out of warranty to be repurposed for a state school in Marylebone that Steve Freeman and his wife are involved with.</p>

<p>Three people have already or about to purchase bicycles through our cycle to work scheme this year so far. By cycling to work they will reduce the load on the Tube/Bus network without polluting the environment. If anybody else is interested please talk to Ina and/or Tim.</p>
