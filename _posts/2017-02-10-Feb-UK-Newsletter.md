Dear All,

I thought I should send another update in this newsletter before I check out for my annual skiing trip tomorrow. There’s some good news at the end (re the 2016 profit share) that you might not want to miss ;-)

Cheers

Wolfgang

1\. HR

Raul, Nasan and Sebastien have now all joined us and it was nice to get to know this years’ new joiners better during lunch earlier this week.
<!--break-->
We have hired another software engineer in Manchester, Matthew Richards, who starts on 20th March, and are in the process of making offers to two more engineers in London.

Ljiljana Evans has left us following our decision not to confirm her appointment at the end of her probationary period. Sabine has decided to accept an offer a finance role in the F&C team of our Swiss sister company and will be moving to Switzerland in May.

We are hoping to have 3 summer interns in the office this year, and have made offers, two of which have been accepted so far.    

2\. Projects

The Mobile X project is in production and the number of users will be gradually ramped up. The project had a good show and tell on Wednesday where we demonstrated Touch-ID login for the first time.

The ITV Commercial Analysis engagement has come to an end. The CA tools are in production, and a smaller team are now doing business as usual work. Rahat has joined Mobile X and Vlad will leave the Commercial Operations project at the end of this month as we do not really want Zuhlke staff on their own at client sites. Vlad will join the HSBC Platform team.

The LV= engagement will reduce to a team of six by the end of March. We are currently negotiating an extension of the order until the end of March 2018. The team will be based at LV= in Hitchin, with the usual Friday visits to our office.

The Drum team have more or less completed work on the Global Risk Monitor part of the development and are focussing their attention now on Travel Protect features. The team will continue to develop until the end of March at which time we will hand over the development to Drum team members.

On Friday we will have a project-kick off for a new features set of the Linde LivIQ solution that will enable Linda to market the solution in Europe. Nasan, Raiyan and Susan will work on this project.

Also on Friday we hope to kick-off another project for Linde that will develop UX prototypes of a patient pathway application that Jesper will be working on.


3\. Sales

Bryan and Brewster are handling negotiations for the master agreement for Ellipse to re-engineer their digital group risk insurance solution. The client has given us a start date for a team in April-May time.

Bryan has responded to an RfP for PDF Factsheet generation for a Fund of Funds called LGT Vestra Wealth, who apparently have other work that they might like us to do.

We have received an RfP from Hive for developing a home automation gateway.

We have also received an RfP for a Discovery phase to improve the user experience of readers in the British Library.

We have have participated in a pre-qualification round at the UK Passport Office for a digital solution to handle lost or stolen passports.

There is an opportunity to place a team into Tandem, a startup-bank that aims to challenge the big four banks with more appealing digital solutions, and to work again with Paul Clark, whom some of you know from when he was at ITV and HSBC.


4\. Group News

At the Group Executive Committee we have decided to open Zuhlke Asia in June with an office in Singapore. The company will be incorporated next week. We will also incorporate a Branch of Zuhlke Asia in Hong Kong and it is now increasingly likely that HSBC will place an order for a sizeable team to work in Hong Kong. We have commenced contract negotiations with HSBC and I will give an update in my next newsletter.

5\. Finance

Our EBITB margin in 2016 was 17.8% (the highest in the Group). As a result, there will be a profit share payment from ZUK of 6% of your 2016 salary that you will receive with the February payroll. As in previous years, it is possible to pay this into your pension plan, in which case Zuhlke will contribute an additional 13.8% of the profit share payment based on saved National Insurance contributions.

The Group’s EBITB margin in 2016 was 14.8% and there will be another profit share payment from Zuhlke Group of 3% of the 2016 salary that you earned while you were employed after you completed your first probationary period with any Zuhlke Group company. This payment will be made with the April salary when the audited accounts are available.

Overall, the Zuhlke Group had 19.5MCHF in pre-tax earnings in 2016 of which we will share 7.6MCHF (39%) with all Group staff through local and group profit sharing schemes. The remainder will be set aside for investments, most notably the fit out of new offices in Eschborn and Schlieren, corporation taxes, increasing of reserves and a small dividend payment to shareholders.
