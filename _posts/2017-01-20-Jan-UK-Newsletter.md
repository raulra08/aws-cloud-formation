Dear All,

Below you’ll find the first newsletter edition of 2017. Enjoy reading

1\. HR

Philipp Morier and Ben Doering left us at the end of last year. We hope that Ben will join Zuhlke in Hong Kong after he has performed his National Service in Switzerland. Sadly James Every has also tendered his resignation. He has decided to leave London in a fortnight to be able to spend more time with his wife, who lives in Italy.
<!--break-->
We have quite a few new starters since the last staff meeting. Waddaah Abdu joined us as an Associate Software Engineer in mid December. When we returned after the holidays, Mo Rahmesanpoor was finally able to join us as a permanent member of staff after we have managed to sponsor, and he obtained, his Tier-2 Visa. Jason Costa joined us as an Associate Software Engineer, and Susan Engel joined us as a Senior UX Consultant. Next week, Raul Rodriguez will join us as an Associate Software Engineer and Sebastien Chatal will join us as a Senior Software Engineer. Nasan Baasanjav will join us as a Senior Software Engineer in the first week of February.

We are still looking to hire a DevOps engineer, an experienced Java Software Engineer and a Lead Consultant for embedded software development. If you know of anybody suitable please get in touch. For those of you who have not been with us for long, you might like to know that successful introductions of staff will be rewarded with a £1,000 referral bonus.

As a result of the last round of appraisals and probation reviews we are pleased to announce the following promotions:
Yurena Cabrera – to Software Engineer
Kevin Denver – to Lead Engineer
Daniel Gartmann – to Lead Security Consultant
Phil Hudson – to Lead Consultant
Lachezar Kozhuharov – to Senior Software Engineer
Vladimir Radzivil – to Lead Consultant
Please join me in congratulating Yurena, Kevin, Daniel, Phil, Lacho and Vlad! They have worked hard for their promotions, which are very well deserved.

We have decided to have the Zuhlke UK camp in the UK this year (for a change). Tim has found a wonderful newly refurbished hotel on the shore of Lake Windemere that is large enough to accommodate the full company. The Lake District is easy to reach by train from London and Manchester and is one of the most beautiful places in this country, with many possibilities for outdoor and sporting activities. Camp will be held in the week commencing Sept 18th. An Outlook invite for the full week has been sent out to all of you. Lynne will be organizing the camp programme this year – feel free to contact her with suggestions.

The 2018 camp will most likely be held in June, as we will have the Zuhlke Days conference (for the entire Zuhlke group) in September 2018 in Stuttgart. We are starting the search for a suitable overseas camp location this week – the larger we grow the more notice is required to get a good conference hotel at affordable rates.

We have received the results of the Best Employer Survey that we conducted at the end of last year. The overall engagement score is much the same as in the previous year. We have gone through the detailed summaries of your responses and are in the process of formulating an action plan that we will discuss at the next staff meeting at the end of March.


2\. Projects

We have had (verbal) orders for project extensions from the HSBC Security Platform for the full year and the Platform Engineering team until September. Together with the Mobile X extension we signed just before the holidays this means HSBC will be our largest client (by far) in 2017. Of the new joiners, Sebastien will join the HSBC Platform Team and Nasan and Raul will join the security team.

We have had a request for an extension from LV for a (slightly reduced) LV team to further develop the Retirements Account Solution between April and March 2018. Jason Costa will take over from Andre C, who will join the Mobile X team. Natalia will join the HSBC Security Team.

The ITV Commercial Analysis project (CASPA) is switching to BAU and Rahat will leave ITV in a couple of weeks to join the Mobile X team at HSBC. Vlad will still continue with the ITV Commercial Operations project will continue for a while.

LiDCO are placing small work orders for the haemodynamic monitors that Raiyan is working on.

The Drum team are preparing for an important trade show where Drum Cussac want to demo the GRM and TP solution we are building for them. We currently have budget for the team until Mid march but are negotiating an extension with the client.


3\. Sales

We have lost a bid for an Alpha phase for a Digital Service at the Dept. of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.

Mike is negotiating a web interface for an embedded device at Servomex, who produce sensors and actuators for oil and gas installations.

Keith and Adam offered a Discovery phase offered at AO.com for efficiency improvements in their logistics and warehouse operation.

Bryan and Susan are working on a proposal for generating PDFs for fact sheets at LGT Vestra Wealth.


4\. Premises

Last year, we published an environmental policy that is aimed at minimising the impact of our operations in London and Manchester on the environment. The policy is available in the quality manual by following the above link.

One of the guidelines in the policy is that we should procure our electricity from a Green Energy provider – we are using Opus Energy. I have obtained the breakdown of the wholesale electricity that they provide to us. According to this breakdown 93% of the electricity we used in 2016 was generated from renewable sources, 3% from Natural Gas, 2% from Coal, 1% from Nuclear and 1% from others. Because our heating and air conditioning is provided by (electrically powered) heat pumps we can fairly claim that our contribution to C02 emissions and radioactive waste is minimal.


5\. Finance

We have closed the books for 2016 and will have the accounts audited from Monday. Zuhlke UK managed to generate revenue of £7.113M (up from £5.9M in 2015) and we generated earnings before tax and profit share (EBITB) of £1.266M (up from £880k). Judging by EBITB margin, Zuhlke UK was the most profitable company of the Zuhlke Group in 2016. In line with the profit sharing scheme you can expect to receive with your February salary a UK profit share in the region of 6% of the gross salary you were paid in 2016. The accounts of the Zuhlke Group are still being consolidated and I should be able to provide details about the group profit share with you in my next newsletter.
